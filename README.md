# Functional programming
  These are the programs that i made in functional programming course. They are made in Python and the main projects that i did in this course are the "EP1" and the "EP2" (pratic exercise 1 and 2).

  - The "EP1" is a program that simulates a machine to sell some products and contabilize the money in the cash register in each sell and provides the change to the client.

 - The "EP2" is a program to calculate some integrals by approximation and numeric methods. After calculate the integral, it generate the graphs of the function and compares the error of each method using the matplotlib library.
